			<h2>Project Context</h2>
			<article>
				The project consists of creating a <em>vertical slice</em> of an isometric 3D game that explores the theme of "inclusion" and aims to include as many people as possible.</br>
				A team of 6 people worked on this task over a period of 8 months. </br>
				The game can be developed using the engine of your choice.

				<h3>Theme of Our Game</h3>
				Our game focuses on <em>depression</em>. The player takes on the role of a gender-neutral middle school student who is a victim of harassment.
				This protagonist must confront their fears, represented as bosses.
				They must solve different puzzles to fight their fears in an exciting and diverse Boss Rush experience. </br></br>

				We wanted to explore the theme of depression through three main aspects:
				<ul>
					<li>Resistance to Others' Attacks: The player must dodge the boss's attacks without being able to counterattack, experiencing the weight of the other's attacks.</li>
					<li>Thinking on Their Feet: The player must solve riddles while dodging the boss's attacks, with the riddles not intended to be difficult.</li>
					<li>Revolution in the Face of the Problem: The player can attack the boss at specific moments when they take breaks in their attack pattern.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Project Creation Date</h3>
				The "red thread" project was created during the third year at <em>Gaming Campus</em>, in the bachelor's program with a specialization in video games.

				<h3>Team</h3>
				The team consists of 3 developers in their third year at Gaming Campus and 3 artists in their first year at Gaming Campus.

				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>Selected Engine</em></br>
						Unity3D for developers / Maya and Zbrush for artists.
					</li></br>

					<li>
						<em>Language Used</em></br>
						The language used by developers is C#.
					</li></br>

					<li>
						<em>Time Limit</em></br>
						4 x 2 weeks, or 8 weeks, spread over 8 months.
					</li></br>

					<li>
						<em>Additional Information</em></br>
						Introducing the "Alpha Version" to <a href="https://twitter.com/indiegamelyon?lang=en" title="Twitter Indie Game Lyon">Lyon Indie Game</a> for playtesting. The game then had 4 weeks of reflection/development.
